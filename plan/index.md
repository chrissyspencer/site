# 2017 Transportation Plan

We are working together to produce a joint neighborhood transportation plan.

We've contracted with [UrbanTrans](http://urbantrans.com/) to engage with the community for input and incorporate relevant details from plans such as the Atlanta transportation plan, the Beltline Master Plan (sub-area 4 overlay), Imagine Memorial and Renew Atlanta initiatives, [Livable Centers Initiative](http://www.atlantaregional.com/land-use/livable-centers-initiative).
