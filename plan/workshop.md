# Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Transportation Committee

We are working together to produce a joint neighborhood transportation plan.

The city of Atlanta is in the process of investing in transportation upgrades on a scale that has not been seen in decades. Several high-profile projects underway, such as the Atlanta BeltLine extension, MARTA expansion (which received the highest level of support from our voting precinct), and improvement projects along Boulevard and Memorial drive, **will have a direct impact on how we get around in Cabbagetown and Reynoldstown**. In order to make sure that these upgrades best serve the needs of our residents and businesses, the Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Transportation committee **is organizing a neighborhood planning workshop where neighbors can share their transportation needs and concerns with a professional planning agency**. The results will be compiled into a comprehensive plan that will help guide future transportation development.

## Transportation Planning Workshop

We've contracted with [UrbanTrans](http://urbantrans.com/) to engage with the community for input and incorporate relevant details from plans such as the Atlanta transportation plan, the Beltline Master Plan (sub-area 4 overlay), Imagine Memorial and Renew Atlanta initiatives, [Livable Centers Initiative](http://www.atlantaregional.com/land-use/livable-centers-initiative).
