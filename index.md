# Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Transportation Committee

> Committee to address issues of transportation and mobility in the Cabbagetown & Reynoldstown neighborhoods of Atlanta, GA.

## 2017 Transportation Plan

We are working together to produce a joint neighborhood transportation plan.

We've contracted with [UrbanTrans](http://urbantrans.com/) to engage with the community for input and incorporate relevant details from plans such as the Atlanta transportation plan, the Beltline Master Plan (sub-area 4 overlay), Imagine Memorial and Renew Atlanta initiatives, [Livable Centers Initiative](http://www.atlantaregional.com/land-use/livable-centers-initiative).

Learn more about this at at the next Reynoldstown Community Improvement League meeting: [Monday, May 8th](https://www.facebook.com/events/1902220833393420/).
